Experience with vanilla JS

Learning vanilla JS to create the pulldown menu (ours is more of a pull-to-the-side) generate the images and buttons via the DOM took a little bit of work to understand at first. But after we got the hang of it, it became much more straightforward to create new themes and functions for different things (e.g., switching the theme). Also, we appreciate that our code is much cleaner and more concise than it was when we had a bunch of HTML div/img/audio/etc. tags to create the soundboard like in HW1. Even though we added way more functionality in our app, the number of lines of code actually went down from HW2, and is much easier to follow and debug.

Experience with jQuery: 

Working with jQuery was very similar as with the Vanilla js in the way that the syntax is very much still similar. The big advantage with the jQuery library was that it shortened the amount of code a bit. It was mainly the syntax that was shorter. Also, in comparison with the vanilla js, jquery seemed to run a lot smoother during load times, probably due to the '$(document).ready' call where it made sure everything else was loaded before it executed the js. Also from what I can tell on throttling the two versions on 3G, jquery seems to be ~50-100 ms faster sometimes
(~350 ms compared to ~250 ms)
